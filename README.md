# 📚 Teaching Portfolio

A structured collection of **course materials, syllabi, and code examples** drawn from both my self-study and classroom teaching experience.  
> *Demonstrates my ability to design, structure, and deliver programming, data analysis, algorithms, and machine learning courses, as well as supplementary technical subjects.*

## 🌱 Educational Philosophy

1. **Clarity** – Plain-language explanations and visual aids  
2. **Application** – Linking theory with real-world datasets, especially in finance and NLP  
3. **Critical Thinking** – Encouraging students to assess algorithmic bias and ethical implications

## 🗂 Documentation Consistency — Mini README Template

To ensure clarity and coherence, I use the following **standard template** for documenting each module or topic folder.

```markdown
# Module Title  
*(e.g., Data Cleaning — Handling Missing and Outlier Values)*  

## 🎯 Learning Objectives  
- Briefly list what this module teaches or demonstrates.  
- Keep points concise and outcome-oriented.  

## 📂 Contents  
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks or scripts implementing the topic  
- `data/` – Sample datasets (if applicable)  
- `outputs/` – Generated figures, processed data, or reports  

## 🛠 Methods & Tools  
- Key algorithms, libraries, or frameworks used  
- Any notable parameter choices or configurations  

## 🔍 Key Insights  
- Summary of the main findings, challenges, or design trade-offs  
- Highlight connections to real-world applications or research  

## 📚 References  
- Academic papers, tutorials, or official docs consulted  
- Include DOI/URL for easy access  

## ✅ Reflection (Optional)  
- Pitfalls encountered  
- Design choices and rationale  
- Potential extensions or open questions  
```

- 💡 How to Use
For each research-oriented topic (e.g., 08_graph_algorithms/), create a README.md using the above template.
This transforms your repository into a reproducible and reviewable research notebook, ideal for showcasing your methodological thinking to PhD selection committees.
